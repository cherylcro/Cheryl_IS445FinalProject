    Dear Web Surfer,</br></br>

        I have enjoyed learning a great deal about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ASP.NET this semester.  THe skills I have learned I feel very comfortable with and look forward to expanding upon them in the future.</br></br>  

        I do regret that the course has ended since I have certainly not mastered every skill taught.  I wish I could learn more about the programming side of web-development. Namely, the JavaScript and coding behind the excellent server controls in ASP.NET.  Alas, I hope to read more over the summer and try to enhance this knowledge further.</br></br>

        Web-development is the future and I am grateful to have had an opportunity to study it.</br></br>

                                                                Regards,</br></br>

                                                                Cheryl Croshaw
